        <p>Hi! My name is Josh. I grew up in Idaho Falls,ID, but now live in Marsing,ID right on the Snake River. My wife and I welcomed our first baby into the world last monday, and she is gorgeous! We also look forward to sleeping a full 8hrs again!
            <p>The only coding experience I have is with SQL, so I'm excited to learn something new in this class! I am a Business Managment major. I like to watch TV with my wife, plan fun trips, and I play the cello.<p>
         <p>Here is a picture of me and my wife when I used to be skinny haha!</p>
