      <p>
        Six-year-old me was obsessed with arts and crafts. One day I discovered bakeable clay! That was when my creative freedom could roam free. 
        My sister and I loved making everything and everything, but the one we were most proud of was our nativities. 
        We made them for anyone in the family that we could think of- aunts, uncles, you name it. 
        Fast forward to now, I am an adult who still loves arts and crafts, but my tastes have also shifted towards creating businesses. 
        Put the two together and the Kelly Krafts was born! It all started with these nativities, but I’m expanding to other areas as well, such as crochet and jewelry making. 
        That’s what this site is for. Please take a look at all of my beloved creations and I hope you can find a place in your home for them too! - Annie
